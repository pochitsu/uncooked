Hi! This is the game I made in Unity! With the help of the tutorial, Unity community, and Stack Overflow. I didn't make it public because this was meant to be a practice game only :)
You can download the playable file from here https://pochitsu.itch.io/kc-uncooked . The password is 09062024. I hope you guys enjoy it!
This project inspired me to enroll in a more in-depth course about Unity, so stay tuned for more projects in the future!
